# ProgramHider
ProgramHider is a program that I built to hide programs from the Desktop/Screen and the Taskbar. SLN source is included in the .zip file, but you can also alternatively download just the .exe file.

#
**Controls:**


`\ (Backslash)` to Hide/Show Window

`INSERT` to close ProgramHider
#

# More Info
ProgramHider can not hide some fullscreen applications. Fullscreen Windowed hasn't been tested yet, but should still work. Fullscreen applications will still be hidden from the taskbar, but the window will not.

ProgramHider.exe will attempt to create a System Tray icon. If it can't, you will get an error, but the program will still run without it. I integrated a Systray icon as an indicator that the program is running.
